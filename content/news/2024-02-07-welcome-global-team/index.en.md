In 2023 we [announced openings](https://rladies.org/news/2023-04-11-global-team-recruiting/) for roles on the R-Ladies Global Team that support organizational efforts and facilitate the growth of the R-Ladies community.
We are delighted to welcome 13 new members to the R-Ladies Global Team.

# Onboarding process

With these amazing new members, we have also been able to develop
a new onboarding system for the Global Team. By using GitHub actions
and issues, we hope that the onboarding process will be more streamlined
in the future.
While the current new members did experience this system in its infancy,
we hope that it will be a smoother process for future members.

# What the future holds

We are excited to see what the future holds for R-Ladies with these new
members of the Global Team. Having new people, with fresh ideas and 
perspectives, will help us to continue to grow and improve as an organization.
We are looking forward to working with these new members, and we hope
that you will join us in welcoming them to the Global Team!
